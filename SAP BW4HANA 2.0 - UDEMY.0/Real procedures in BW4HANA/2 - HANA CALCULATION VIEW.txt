1 - CREATE A NON-STRUCTURAL PACKAGE IN WHICH CALCULATION VIEW IS GOING TO BE CREATED

    - Go to repository window, right click New > Repository Package 
    
    - Create previuos repository package created follow same process to create a subpackage and named it as you want (EG CALC_VIEW). 
      <MAIN REPO PACKAGE>.<CHILD PACKAGE>  

 2 - CREATE CALCULATION VIEW
    
      - Right click over child package and create a calculation view. 

        - provide a name following naming conventions eg: ZCV_<BUSSINESS MODEL NAME>_DIM
        - Subtype : Standard. 
        - Calculation view Types : select Graphical, SQL Script is obsolet. 
        - Data category : depends of the purpose os the object. Eg. DIMENSION (could be expose for Analisys for office, leaving it on blank NOT)
        
    - Go to CV View properties tab on details seccion: 

        - Set Default cliente as "Cross Session". (Best practice) 
        - Apply Privileges : Classical Analitic Privileges
    
    - Go to designer: 

      - Create a new Projection node. (Best Practice). Allows you to have a Filters Expresion. 
      - Drag and Drop from data remote source tree the element you want to add. (Staging Table)
      - Select from the fields list just the needed ones. 
      - Connect the Projection you create to the existing one (top projection).
      - Select all fields from projection you created by clicking right selecting Add to Output or Select your projection,
        go to Ouput Window > Column select all fields , then right click over them and select Propagate to Semantics.

      - If input parameters are needed: 
        - Go to Parameter/Variables Tab an selecct green plus icon > select Create input parameter or Variable. 
        - Parameter type : 
            Direct : Write directly without any help.
            Column : (provide help to select input value).
            Derived from table: 
            Static list : Chose estricted options to be selected.
            Derived from Procedure/Scalar function.

            * If column option is choosen select the sources table to be the staging table. (BEST PRACTICE).

        - Then go to projection > outpu window > Filter folder > Expression.
            
            - Select from Columns folder the field you want to restrict and from Input parameter choose the input created priviuosly. 
        
    - Active the calculation view object.   

      NOTE: In order to avoid any authorization issue, ensure that _sys_repo user has granted to your remote source schema. 

        sql statement to grant _sys_repo user: 

          GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA <SCHEMA NAME> TO <USER NAME> WITH GRANT OPTION. 

    - If Join or Union with 2 or more table is needed: 

      - Add Join/Union element in between top projection and joinable table projection desired. 
      - Link source table projection to target join element. 
      - Select Join element and perform join type (inner, left, right ...) and  conditions. (Rght click New Join), 
        choose Cardinality if you know what cardinality you need, if not, HANA will provide by default. 
      - (IN CASE YOU ARE HANDLELING JOIN BETWEEN TEXT TABLE)If you need language is selected automactly based on your login user preference,
       select Text join and select Language column of table you are joining with. Act as LEFT OUTER JOIN. 

    Note:  Language selection also could be achieved using standard system variables : $$CLIENT$$ , $$LANGUAGE$$ ...
